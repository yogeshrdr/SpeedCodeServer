Problem Description: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/window-sliding-technique/


Let’s start with a problem for illustration where we can apply this technique:

Given an array of integers of size ‘n’.
Our aim is to calculate the maximum sum of ‘k’ 
consecutive elements in the array.

Input  : arr[] = {100, 200, 300, 400}
         k = 2
Output : 700

Input  : arr[] = {1, 4, 2, 10, 23, 3, 1, 0, 20}
         k = 4 
Output : 39
We get maximum sum by adding subarray {4, 2, 10, 23}
of size 4.

Input  : arr[] = {2, 3}
         k = 3
Output : Invalid
There is no subarray of size 3 as size of whole
array is 2.",Aditya Verma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHCGAZBbB88,SlidingWindow

Problem Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/

Given two strings s and t, return the minimum window in s which will contain all the characters in t. If there is no such window in s that covers all characters in t, return the empty string """".

Note that If there is such a window, it is guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = ""ADOBECODEBANC"", t = ""ABC""
Output: ""BANC""
Example 2:

Input: s = ""a"", t = ""a""
Output: ""a""

Stock Span Problem,"The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of n daily price quotes for a stock and we need to calculate span of stock’s price for all n days.
The span Si of the stock’s price on a given day i is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days just before the given day, for which the price of the stock on the current day is less than or equal to its price on the given day.
For example, if an array of 7 days prices is given as {100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85}, then the span values for corresponding 7 days are {1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6}

Problem Description: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/game-of-death-in-a-circle/0


There are n people standing in a circle (numbered clockwise 1 to n) waiting to be executed. The counting begins at point 1 in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction (clockwise). In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed. The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), until only the last person remains, who is given freedom.
Given the total number of persons n and a number k which indicates that k-1 persons are skipped and kth person is killed in circle. The task is to choose the place in the initial circle so that you are the last one remaining and so survive.
Consider if n = 5 and k = 2, then the safe position is 3.
Firstly, the person at position 2 is killed, then person at position 4 is killed, then person at position 1 is killed. Finally, the person at position 5 is killed. So the person at position 3 survives.",Aditya Verma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULUNeD0N9yI,Recursion

1 Binary Search Format Introduction,"BINARY SEARCH FORMAT INTRODUCTION:

Binary search is a little different than other algorithms we have covered because it can be applied to a large variety of problems, and the implementation of each could vary quite a bit. For instance, you can use a binary search to find the square root of a number, to determine if a list contains a specific number, or to determine which git commit caused a bug in your code (git bisect does this).

To help with this, I have selected practice problems that each illustrate a unique way that a binary search can be used. I definitely recommend checking out all of them , even if you feel you understand binary search; chances are you will learn at least one new way to apply the algorithm.

What is binary search?
In it’s simplest form, binary search is an algorithm used to search for an item in a sorted listed.

PLAYLIST LINK:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWeYfhtuKHj-9MpYb6XQJ_f2",Aditya Verma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7NodO9HIbk,BinarySearch
2 Binary Search,"Given a sorted array arr[] of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in arr[].

Binary Search: Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

3 Binary Search on Reverse Sorted Array,"BINARY SEARCH ON REVERSE SORTED ARRAY:

Let's suppose that we have an array sorted in descending order and we want to find index of an element e within this array. Binary search in every step picks the middle element (m) of the array and compares it to e. If these elements are equal, than it returns the index of m. If e is greater than m, than e must be located in the left subarray. On the contrary, if m greater than e, e must be located in the right subarray. At this moment binary search repeats the step on the respective subrarray.

Because the algoritm splits in every step the array in half (and one half of the array is never processed) the input element must be located (or determined missing) in at most \\log_{2}{n} steps.

Since array is sorted, the first thing clicks into mind is binary search, but the problem here is that we don’t know size of array.
If the array is infinite, that means we don’t have proper bounds to apply binary search. So in order to find position of key, first we find bounds and then apply binary search algorithm.

Let low be pointing to 1st element and high pointing to 2nd element of array, Now compare key with high index element,
-if it is greater than high index element then copy high index in low index and double the high index.
-if it is smaller, then apply binary search on high and low indices found.

Dynamic programming on Trees Introduction and Identification,"DP on Trees-Introduction and Identification
Dynamic Programming(DP) is a technique to solve problems by breaking them down into overlapping sub-problems which follows the optimal substructure. There are various problems using DP like subset sum, knapsack, coin change etc. DP can also be applied on trees to solve some specific problems.

We define functions for nodes of the trees, which we calculate recursively based on children of a nodes. One of the states in our DP usually is a node i, denoting that we are solving for the subtree of node i.

Possible Bipartition | Bipartite graph | Graph coloring | Leetcode #886,"This video explains a very important programming interview problem which is to find if we can divide all the incompatible persons into 2 different SETs.This is a very important problem for FAANG companies.The problem is based on finding possible bipartition.In case we have a possible bipartition then we will return true otherwise false.I have given 2 methods to solve this problem. The first one is just an idea about how to solve this using two MAPs or two SETs.The second approach is by using the classical bipartite graph algorithm.I have explained the intuition for solving this problem using graph algorithm.I have shown how this problem is reduced to just finding if a graph is bipartite then just return TRUE saying that it is possible to divide the incompatible persons into 2 different SETs.I have also shown how we canuse the graph coloring algorithm to solve this problem using 2-colors method of coloring graph. We have used only 2-color method because this is used to find if we have an ODD cycle length or an EVEN cycle length.Since, a bipartite graph never have an ODD length cycle, so, if we find any ODD length cycle then the graph will not be bipartite and hence it will not be possible to divide all incompitable persons into 2 different SETs.I have shown the working of algorithm followed by CODE walkthrough in C++ at the end of the video.

Kosaraju Algorithm | Strongly connected components in a graph,"This video explains the Kosaraju algorithm which is used to find all the strongly connected components in a graph.We can even use this algorithm to find if the given graph is strongly connected or not.I have shown the concepts of strongly connected components in the beginning of the video and then explained some properties of graph which we can use to find the strongly connected components.I have explained the kosaraju algorithm using simple DFS and stack.This is a 3 step process.The first step is to traverse the graph using DFS and then push the nodes in stack.The second step is to find transpose of the graph, that is, reverse all the edges in the graph.The third step is to pop nodes one by one from stack and make DFS calls to find the nodes in a strongly connected component.I have also shown why the kosaraju algorithm logic works using the transpose graph logic.At the end of the video, I have explained the code walk through.CODE LINK is present below as usual.

Euler Graph | Euler Circuit | Euler Path | Eulerian Graph | Semi Eulerian Graph | Algorithm | CODE,"In this video, I have explained everything you need to know about euler graph, euler path and euler circuit.I have first explained all the concepts like Walk, Trail, Euler Circuit, Euler Path, Eulerian Graph, Semi Eulerian graph and a non Eulerian graph.I have explained the conditions for a graph to be of a certain type using intuition and simple examples.After the concepts, I have shown the algorithm for detecting the type of eulerian graph.The algorithm is just a simple 2 step process where the first step is about multi-component case.All the edges must be present in a single component.The second step counts the number of nodes with odd degree.If count of odd degree nodes are even then graph is eulerian because euler circuit will be present in graph.If count of odd degree nodes is 2 then it will be a semi eulerian graph because we will have a euler path but not euler circuit.Rest all count cases will fall in a non euler graph.At the end of the video, I have also explained the CODE.

1 Heap Introduction and Identification,"1)A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.",Aditya Verma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW8PrQrvMNc,heap
2 Kth Smallest Element,"Given an array and a number k where k is smaller than size of array, we need to find the k’th smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

Example:
Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}
k = 3
Output: 7",Aditya Verma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BfL2Hjvh8g,heap
3 Return K largest Elements in array,"rite an efficient program for printing k largest elements in an array. Elements in array can be in any order.

For example, if given array is [1, 23, 12, 9, 30, 2, 50] and you are asked for the largest 3 elements i.e., k = 3 then your program should print 50, 30 and 23.",Aditya Verma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DdP6Ef8YZM,heap
4 Sort a K Sorted Array | Sort Nearly Sorted Array,"Given an array of n elements, where each element is at most k away from its target position, devise an algorithm that sorts in O(n log k) time. For example, let us consider k is 2, an element at index 7 in the sorted array, can be at indexes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in the given array.

Example:
Input : arr[] = {6, 5, 3, 2, 8, 10, 9}
k = 3 
Output : arr[] = {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10}",Aditya Verma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYfM6J1y0mU,heap
5 K Closest Numbers,"Given an unsorted array and two numbers x and k, find k closest values to x.
Input : arr[] = {10, 2, 14, 4, 7, 6}, x = 5, k = 3",Aditya Verma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8yLD-x7fBI,heap
6 Top K Frequent Numbers,"Given an array of n numbers. Your task is to read numbers from the array and keep at-most K numbers at the top (According to their decreasing frequency) every time a new number is read. We basically need to print top k numbers sorted by frequency when input stream has included k distinct elements, else need to print all distinct elements sorted by frequency.

Example:
Input :  arr[] = {5, 2, 1, 3, 2}
k = 4
Output : 5 2 5 1 2 5 1 2 3 5 2 1 3 5",Aditya Verma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VoJn544QrM,heap
7 Frequency Sort,"Print the elements of an array in the increasing frequency if 2 numbers have same frequency then print the one which came first.

Example:
Input : arr[] = {2, 5, 2, 8, 5, 6, 8, 8}
Output : arr[] = {8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 5, 5, 6}",Aditya Verma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLR5aMzYGGk,heap
8 K Closest Points To Origin,"Given a list of points on the 2-D plane and an integer K. The task is to find K closest points to the origin and print them.

Note: The distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.

Example:
Input : point = [[3, 3], [5, -1], [-2, 4]], K = 2",Aditya Verma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC4EotTewro,heap
9 Connect Ropes to Minimise the Cost,"There are given n ropes of different lengths, we need to connect these ropes into one rope. The cost to connect two ropes is equal to sum of their lengths. We need to connect the ropes with minimum cost.

For example if we are given 4 ropes of lengths 4, 3, 2 and 6. We can connect the ropes in following ways.
1) First connect ropes of lengths 2 and 3. Now we have three ropes of lengths 4, 6 and 5.
2) Now connect ropes of lengths 4 and 5. Now we have two ropes of lengths 6 and 9.
3) Finally connect the two ropes and all ropes have connected.

Total cost for connecting all ropes is 5 + 9 + 15 = 29. This is the optimized cost for connecting ropes. Other ways of connecting ropes would always have same or more cost. For example, if we connect 4 and 6 first (we get three strings of 3, 2 and 10), then connect 10 and 3 (we get two strings of 13 and 2). Finally we connect 13 and 2. Total cost in this way is 10 + 13 + 15 = 38.",Aditya Verma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k_c9nqzKN0,heap
10 Sum of Elements between k1 smallest and k2 smallest numbers,"Given an array of integers and two numbers k1 and k2. Find the sum of all elements between given two k1’th and k2’th smallest elements of the array. It may  be assumed that all elements of array are distinct.

Example :
Input : arr[] = {20, 8, 22, 4, 12, 10, 14},  k1 = 3,  k2 = 6  
Output : 26          
         3rd smallest element is 10. 6th smallest element 
         is 20. Sum of all element between k1 & k2 is
         12 + 14 = 26",Aditya Verma,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ioQQQrnw4Q,heap
TriesImplement TRIE,"This video explains a very important implementation based programming interview problem which is to implement trie. This is one of the most frequently asked question in interviews. Trie is actually a very versatile data structure which can be used to implement dictionary, phone-book, records (like names for students registered in library) and perform search operation in just O(string length) which is very fast as compared to any other method or data structure. Deletion or removal is also very simple and is done in same O(string length) time. We can also find how many people have the same prefix in their names and other such stuffs and hence it is also known as a prefix tree. I have shown the intuition for solving this problem initially and then i have explained the structure for trie node being used and after that i have explained the algorithm using an example and finally, i have explained the code for the same. CODE LINK is present below as usual. If you find any difficulty or have any query then do COMMENT below. PLEASE help our channel by SUBSCRIBING and LIKE our video if you found it helpful...CYA :)
